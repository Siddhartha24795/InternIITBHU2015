Proxyless Internet access over LAN/WAN
It consists of all codes and the output as screenshot , read the complete documentation to understand the code and working.
In the cases where proxy servers are deployed in explicit mode, most of the software applications (regardless of the platform) do not work. This is because the apps have been designed under the assumption that there is an uninterrupted path out to the Internet, thus if the device is configured to use an explicit proxy, either the app does not use this global setting, or the app itself has no provision to be configured to use an explicit proxy. Therefore, the aim is to provide a Proxy less Internet access, which means that there should be no proxy configuration required on the client side. Transparent proxy deployments typically resolve these issues, as far as the application or devices are concerned, it has an uninterrupted connection out to the internet, and therefore work as intended. But, the usual authentication procedure (challenging the user for valid credentials before they can use the proxy) does not work for transparent proxy deployments. This is because the client does not know about the presence of a proxy server. Therefore, a captive portal may be used to validate a user. Thus, the proposed solution involves using a transparent proxy in conjunction with a captive portal to get the applications working
